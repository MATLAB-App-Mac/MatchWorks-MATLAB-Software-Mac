## üß† Overview
**MATLAB**, developed by *MathWorks*, is an advanced programming environment designed for numerical computation, simulation, and algorithm development.  
It provides engineers, scientists, and data analysts with an integrated workspace to explore data, design systems, and visualize results ‚Äî all within a single, unified platform.  

With built-in support for **Simulink**, **machine learning**, **signal processing**, and **control systems**, **MATLAB** bridges the gap between theoretical research and real-world implementation.  
Its intuitive syntax and vast library of toolboxes make it ideal for both beginners and experts working on large-scale modeling and analysis.  

Optimized for **macOS**, MATLAB fully leverages Apple Silicon performance, offering faster simulations, smoother visualization, and an enhanced user experience across complex computational workflows.
